## Privacy Policy

### Google Analytics
We use Google Analytics to collect information about how visitors use our website. The information collected is anonymous and does not identify individuals. It includes:

- The pages you visit
- How long you spend on each page
- How you got to the site
- What you click on while you're visiting the site

This information helps us improve our website and services. Google Analytics uses cookies to collect this information. You can opt out of Google Analytics tracking by using the [Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on](https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout).

We do not share your personal information with third parties unless required by law. For more information about how Google processes your data, please visit [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

### Data Collection
We collect some information when you submit forms on the website; this may include any fields you fill out (like your name, email address, or any other information you provide). Here's how we handle that data:

#### Email Newsletter
If you sign up for the email newsletter (which we totally recommend!), we collect your email address, and the IP address you used to sign up.  We use this information to:
1. Confirm your subscription by sending you a confirmation email.
2. Send you the newsletter and any other updates or information related to our programs.

You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time by clicking the "unsubscribe" link at the bottom of any email we send you. We will remove your email address from our mailing list promptly.  If that doesn't work, please contact the site administrator at [{{ site.admin_email }}](mailto:{{ site.admin_email }}) to request manual removal.

#### Volunteer Hour Tracking Tool
If you use our [Volunteer Hour Tracking Tool]({{ '/hours' | relative_url}}), we collect the following information:
- Your name (first and last, or just first if you prefer)
- Your email address
- Your phone number, if provided
- The hours you volunteer, including the date, time, and description of the activity

We use this information to track your volunteer hours, especially for Confirmation students who need to log their service hours. This information is stored securely and is only accessible to select members of the youth leadership team and the site administrator.

You have the right to:
- Request access to your data
- Request corrections to your data
- Request deletion of your data

To exercise these rights, please contact the site administrator at [{{ site.admin_email }}](mailto:{{ site.admin_email }}).  Upon request, the site administrator will provide you with a copy of your data, correct any inaccuracies, or delete your data from our records.

The backend of the Volunteer Hour Tracking Tool is Open Source software, and the source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/StAnthonyNovato/SAY-Backend).  For security vulnerabilities, please see the section on [Responsible Vulnerability Disclosure](#responsible-vulnerability-disclosure) below.

## Camera and Recording Policy
We may take photos and videos during our events for promotional purposes. If you do not wish to be photographed or recorded, please let us know in advance, and we will do our best to accommodate your request.

At the beginning of the year, we have everyone sign a photo release form. This form allows us to use photos and videos taken during our youth group events, Confirmation classes, and other activities for promotional purposes. If you have any concerns about this, please let us know so that we can make arrangements.

The Camera Release form is included in the registration packet for all participants. Please review it carefully and let us know if you have any questions or concerns.
