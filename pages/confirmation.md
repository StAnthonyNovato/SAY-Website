## Why Confirmation?

It takes more faith to believe everything came from nothing than to trust in a Supreme Being who created it all, and that Being we call **God**.

But who is this God?  
- Is He near or far?  
- Do I matter to Him or not?  
- Can we know Him and have a relationship with Him?  
- And what do the Church and the sacraments have to do with it?
