# Confirmation Program

Our Confirmation program at St. Anthony de Padua is designed to prepare young Catholics for the Sacrament of Confirmation through comprehensive spiritual formation, service opportunities, and community building.

## Program Overview

Confirmation is one of the seven sacraments of the Catholic Church, completing the process of initiation begun at Baptism and continued through the Eucharist. The Sacrament of Confirmation strengthens and perfects baptismal grace, and deepens our bond with the Church, uniting us more closely to Christ.

Through our program, candidates will:

- Deepen their relationship with Christ through prayer and reflection
- Grow in understanding of Catholic teachings and traditions
- Experience active participation in the life of the Church
- Develop a stronger sense of belonging to the parish community
- Engage in service to others as disciples of Christ
