# About Our Parish & Confirmation Program

## St. Anthony de Padua Catholic Parish

St. Anthony de Padua Catholic Parish has been serving the South Bend community for over 75 years. Our parish is dedicated to living out the Gospel through worship, education, service, and community.

Founded in 1948, our parish has grown to become a vibrant faith community with a strong commitment to Catholic education and formation at all ages. We strive to be a welcoming parish where all can encounter Christ through the sacraments, community life, and service to others.

Our parish is named after St. Anthony of Padua (1195-1231), a Franciscan friar known for his powerful preaching, expert knowledge of scripture, and devotion to the poor and sick. He is the patron saint of lost items, poor people, and travelers.

## Our Confirmation Program

The Sacrament of Confirmation is a significant milestone in the Catholic faith journey. At St. Anthony de Padua, we take great care in preparing young people to receive the gifts of the Holy Spirit and become fully initiated members of the Catholic Church.

### Our Vision

We believe that Confirmation is not an end but rather a beginningâ€”the start of a lifelong journey of faith. Our goal is not simply to prepare young people for the sacrament but to form lifelong disciples who actively live out their faith in the world.

We envision our confirmed youth:
- Growing in their relationship with Christ and the Church
- Participating actively in parish life
- Serving others with compassion and love
- Sharing their faith with others
- Living virtuous lives guided by Catholic teaching

## Parish History

St. Anthony de Padua Parish was established in 1948 to serve the growing Catholic population on the east side of South Bend. The first Mass was celebrated on Easter Sunday, April 17, 1949, in a temporary chapel while the main church was under construction.

The parish school opened in September 1951 with 180 students in grades one through four, under the direction of the Sisters of St. Joseph. Today, St. Anthony School continues to provide excellent Catholic education to children from preschool through eighth grade.

Over the decades, our parish has grown both in numbers and in ministries. We've expanded our facilities, developed comprehensive faith formation programs for all ages, and established numerous outreach ministries to serve our community.

Throughout our history, we have remained committed to our mission of bringing the love of Christ to all through worship, education, service, and community.
